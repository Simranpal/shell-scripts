can store variables like greeting="hello"
echo $greeting

and use them in commands
filename="test.txt"
ls $filename

filenames="test1.txt test2.txt"
touch $filenames

to get value use prefix $
dont use whitespace around =

if variable already exists, it is asssigned new value
bash variable have no type, are case sensitive
