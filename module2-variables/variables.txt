can store variables like greeting="hello"
echo $greeting

and use them in commands
filename="test.txt"
ls $filename

filenames="test1.txt test2.txt"
touch $filenames

to get value use prefix $
dont use whitespace around =

if variable already exists, it is asssigned new value
bash variable have no type, are case sensitive

good habit to use double qoutes "$x"  instead of $x

braces help with distinguishing variable name end

read command to get input into a variable

help & man commands provide doc on the command

DEBUGGING:
to debug use -x in #! shebang line which prints all lines executed in the script file

to debug some lines use set -x and set +x before,after lines to debug
Eg:
set -x
code
set +x
